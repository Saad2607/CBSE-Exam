We have made a project on Writing Pad and Pen.
When the students want to login so before that we have to register student images and name first.
So in the repository we have to add label_images folder then in that folder we have to create a new folder which is student.
In that folder we have to add the images of the student.
And then after we have to register the student photo and name first then only we can access webcam, otherwise the error will show.
